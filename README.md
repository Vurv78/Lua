## How to INSTALL StarfallEx chips/Libraries:
__Method 1 - Copy into GMOD:__
  Unfortunately, this method is slower since you can't directly copy a text file from github.
  1. Open the github public starfall text, of course.
  2. Copy and paste ALL of it into a text file.
  3. Save that file and drag it into your gmod/garrysmod/data/starfall folder
    "gmod" usually being [YOURSTEAMFOLDER]/steamapps/common/GarrysMod
  4. Profit

__Method 2: - Copy into the StarfallEx editor:__
  1. Open the github public e2 text, of course.
  2. Copy and paste it into the expression 2 tool.
  3. Make sure everything is the same to github and that everything pasted successfully.

__Both Methods:__
5. Read for any additional instructions in the form of e2 comments.
## How to USE Expression2s/Libraries:
  #### Libraries:
  1. Use --@include <filepath> in your code with filepath being the filepath of the code you saved the library in.
  2. Look inside the library and the example for how to use the library, as this differs from time to time.
  #### Chips:
  1. Follow the instructions in the written e2 if there are any.
  2a. If there aren't, just read the code to see what it does or make an issue to this github.
