## How to INSTALL StarfallEx chips/Libraries:
__Method 1 - Copy into GMOD:__
  This method is slower since you can't directly copy a text file from github but it's optimal
  1. Open the github public starfall text, of course.
  2. Copy and paste ALL of it into a text file.
  3. Save that file and drag it into your gmod/garrysmod/data/starfall folder
    "gmod" usually being [YOURSTEAMFOLDER]/steamapps/common/GarrysMod
  4. Profit

__Method 2: - Copy into the StarfallEx editor:__
  1. Copy and paste the code into the starfallex editor.
  2. Make sure everything is the same to github and that everything pasted successfully.

__Both Methods:__
5. Read for any additional instructions in the form of comments in the code.
## How to USE the Chips/Libraries:
  #### Libraries:
  1. Use --@include <filepath>.txt in your code with filepath being the filepath of the code you saved the library in.
  2. You may need to require('filepath') without the .txt as well.
  3. Look inside the library and the example for how to use the library, as this differs from time to time.
  #### Chips:
  1. Follow the instructions in the written code if there are any.
  2a. If there aren't, just read the code to see what it does or make an issue to this github.
